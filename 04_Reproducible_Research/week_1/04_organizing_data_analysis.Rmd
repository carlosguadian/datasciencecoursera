## Data analysis files

* Data
  * Raw data
  * Processed data
* Figures
  * Exploratory figures
  * Final figures
* R code
  * Raw / unused scripts
  * Final scripts
  * R Markdown files
* Text
  * README files
  * Text of analysis / report

## Raw Data

![MedicalRedord](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/raw/master/assets/img/medicalrecord.png)

* Should be stored in your analysis folder
* If accessed from the web, include url, description, and date accessed in README

## Processed data
![Excel](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/raw/master/assets/img/excel.png)

* Processed data should be named so it is easy to see which script generated the data. 
* The processing script - processed data mapping should occur in the README
* Processed data should be [tidy](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)

## Exploratory figures
![example 10](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/raw/master/assets/img/example10.png)

* Figures made during the course of your analysis, not necessarily part of your final report.
* They do not need to be "pretty"

## Final Figures

![Final Figures](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/raw/master/assets/img/figure1final.png)

* Usually a small subset of the original figures
* Axes/colors set to make the figure clear
* Possibly multiple panels

## Raw scripts

![Raw Code](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/raw/master/assets/img/rawcode.png)

* May be less commented (but comments help you!)
* May be multiple versions
* May include analyses that are later discarded

## Final scripts

![Final Scripts](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/raw/master/assets/img/finalscript2.png)

* Clearly commented
  * Small comments liberally - what, when, why, how
  * Bigger commented blocks for whole sections
* Include processing details
* Only analyses that appear in the final write-up

## R markdown files

![RMarkDown](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/raw/master/assets/img/rmd.png)

* [R markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/authoring/using_markdown) files can be used to generate reproducible reports
* Text and R code are integrated
* Very easy to create in [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)

## Readme files

![Readme](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/raw/master/assets/img/readme.png)

* Not necessary if you use R markdown
* Should contain step-by-step instructions for analysis
* Here is an example [https://github.com/jtleek/swfdr/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/jtleek/swfdr/blob/master/README.md)

## Text of the document

![Text document](https://github.com/DataScienceSpecialization/courses/raw/master/assets/img/swfdr.png)

* It should include a title, introduction (motivation), methods (statistics you used), results (including measures of uncertainty), and conclusions (including potential problems)
* It should tell a story
* _It should not include every analysis you performed_
* References should be included for statistical methods
