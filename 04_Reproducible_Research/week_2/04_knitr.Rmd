## Problems,	Problems

- Authors	must	undertake	considerable	effort	to	put	data/results	on	the	web	
- Readers	must	download	data/results	individually	and	piece	together	which	data	go	with	which	code sections, etc.	
- Authors/readers	must	manually	interact	with	websites	
- There	is	no	single	document	to	integrate	data	analysis with	textual	representations;	i.e.	data,	code,	and	text are not linked.

## Literate	Statistical	Programming

- Original	idea	comes	from	Don	Knuth	
- An	article	is	a	stream	of	text	and	code
- Analysis	code	is	divided	into	text	and	code	“chunks”	
- Presentation	code	formats	results	(tables,	figures,	etc.)	
- Article	text	explains	what	is	going	on	
- Literate	programs	are	weaved	to	produce	human readable	documents	and	tangled	to	produce	machine readable	documents
- Literate	programming	is	a	general	concept. We need	
  – A	documentation	language	
  – A	programming	language	
- The	original Sweave	system	developed	by Friedrich	Leisch	used	LaTeX	and	R	
- knitr	supports	a	variety	of	documentation languages	

## How	Do	I	Make	My	Work	Reproducible?

- Decide	to	do	it	(ideally	from	the	start)	
- Keep	track	of	things,	perhaps	with	a	version	 control	system	to	track	snapshots/changes	
- Use	software	whose	operation	can	be	coded	
- Don’t	save	output	
- Save	data	in	non-proprietary	formats

## Literate	Programming:	Pros

- Text	and	code	all	in	one	place,	logical	order	
- Data,	results	automatically	updated	to	reflect	external	changes	
- Code	is	live--automatic	“regression	test”	when building	a	document

## Literate	Programming:	Cons

- Text	and	code	all	in	one	place;	can	make documents	difficult	to	read,	especially	if	there	is	a	lot	of	code	
- Can	substantially	slow	down	processing	of documents	(although	there	are	tools	to	help)

## What	is	knitr?

- An	R	package	written	by	Yihui Xie	(while	he	was	a	grad	student	at	Iowa	State)
  – Available	on	CRAN	
- Supports	RMarkdown,	LaTeX,	and	HTML	as	documentation	languages	
- Can	export	to	PDF,	HTML	
- Built	right	into	RStudio	for	your	convenience	

## Requirements

- A	recent	version	of	R	
- A	text	editor	(the	one	that	comes	with	RStudio	is okay)	
- Some	support	packages	also	available	on	CRAN	
- Some	knowledge	of	Markdown,	LaTeX,	or	HTML	
- We	will	use	Markdown	here

## What	is	Markdown?

- A	simplified	version	of	“markup”	languages	
- No	special	editor	required	
- Simple,	intuitive	formatting	elements	
- Complete	information	available	at [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics)

## What	is	knitr	Good	For?

- Manuals	
- Short/medium-length	technical	documents	
- Tutorials	
- Reports	(esp.	if	generated	periodically)	
- Data	preprocessing	documents/summaries

## What	is	knitr	NOT	Good	For?

- Very	long	research	articles	
- Complex	time-consuming	computations	
- Documents	that	require	precise	formatting

## My	First	knitr	Document
First create a new document, and then choose an R Markdown document
![First Knitr Document](./images/first-knitr-document.png)

Use markdown for the text, and for code chunks use ``` like separator
![Code Chunk](./images/code-chunk.png)

To process the document clic ```knitr HTML``` button.
![Process Knitr Document](./images/process-knitr-document.png)

## More	Complicated	Way	
```
library(knitr)
setwd(<working directory>)
knit2html(“document.Rmd”)
browseURL(“document.html”)
```

## Output
Can be in HTML or others like this document that get a github markdown document.
![Output](./images/output.png)

![Markdown document](./images/markdown-document.png)

## A	Few	Notes	

- knitr	will	fill	a	new	document	with	filler	text;	delete	it	
- Code	chunks	begin	with	```{r}	and	end	with	```
- All	R	code	goes	in	between	these	markers	
- Code	chunks	can	have	names,	which	is	useful	when	we start	making	graphics	
```{r firstchunk}
## R code goes here
```
- By	default,	code	in	a	code	chunk	is	echoed,	as	will	the	results	of	the	computation	(if	there	are	results	to	print)

## Processing	of	knitr	Documents	(what	happens	under	the	hood)

- You	write	the	RMarkdown	document	(.Rmd)	
- knitr	produces	a	Markdown	document	(.md)	
- knitr	converts	the	Markdown	document	into HTML	(by	default)	
- .Rmd	->	.md	->	.html	
- You	should	NOT	edit	(or	save)	the	.md	or	.html	documents	until	you	are	finished

## Another	Example
For this code in knitr document
![Another Example](./images/another-example.png)

We get this output. The code is not show, not echoed.
![Output example](./images/output-example.png)

## Hiding	Results
To hide results you have to indicate in chunk like this
![Hide Results](./images/hide-results.png)

Then you get this
![Output Hide Results](./images/output-hide-results.png)

## Inline	Text	Computations
You can make computations in a chunk defining variables to use inline. Don't forget to make ```echo = FALSE``` if you don't want to show your code.
![Inline Computations](./images/inline-computations.png)

You get this
![Output Inline Computations](./images/output-inline-computtations.png)

## Incorporating	Graphics
You can insert graphics, and define in chunk properties like height.
![Insert Graphic](./images/insert-graphic.png)
You get the graphic inline at document
![Output Insert Graphic](./images/output-insert-graphic.png)

In behind the scenes, knitr produces this in HTML to insert image
![Knitr in HTML](./images/knitr-in-html.png)

## Making	Tables	with	xtable
With ```xtable``` you can insert tables in document

First some data
```{r fitmodel}
library(datasets)
data("airquality")
fit <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind + Temp + Solar.R, data = airquality)
```

Second make table and insert inline at document
```{r showtable, results="asis"}
library(xtable)
xt <- xtable(summary(fit))
print(xt, type = "html")
```

## Setting Global Options

- Sometimes	we	want	to	set	options	for	every code	chunk	that	are	different	from	the	 defaults	
- For	example,	we	may	want	to	suppress	all	code	echoing	and	results	output	
- We	have	to	write	some	code	to	set	these	global	options	

![Setting global options](./images/setting-global-options.png)

Then the output is
![Output Global Settings](./images/output-global-settings.png)

## Some common options

- Output	
  – results:	“asis”,	“hide”	
  – echo:	TRUE,	FALSE	
- Figures	
  – fig.height:	numeric	
  – fig.width:	numeric	
  
## Caching computations

- What	if	one	chunk	takes	a	long	time	to	run?	
- All	chunks	have	to	be	re-computed	every	time you	re-knit	the	file	
- The	cache=TRUE op)on	can	be	set	on	a	chunk-bychunk	basis	to	store	results	of	computation	
- After	the	first	run,	results	are	loaded	from	cache	

## Caching	Caveats

- If	the	data	or	code	(or	anything	external)	changes,	you	need	to	re-run	the	cached	code	chunks	
- Dependencies	are	not	checked	explicitly	
- Chunks	with	significant	side	effects	may	not	be	cacheable	

## Summary

- Literate	statistical	programming	can	be	a	useful	way	to	put	text,	code,	data,	output	all	in	one	document	
- knitr	is	a	powerful	tool	for	integrating	code	and	text	in	a	simple	document	format
