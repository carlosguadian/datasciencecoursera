## Coding Standards for R

1. Always use text files / text editor

2. Indent your code

3. Limit the width of your code (80 columns?)

4. Limit the length of individual functions

## Indenting

* Indenting improves readability

* Fixing line length (80 columns) prevents lots of nesting and very long functions

* Suggested: Indents of 4 spaces at minimum; 8 spaces ideal
