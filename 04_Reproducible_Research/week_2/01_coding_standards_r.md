Coding Standards in R
================

## Coding Standards for R

1.  Always use text files / text editor

2.  Indent your code

3.  Limit the width of your code (80 columns?)

4.  Limit the length of individual functions

## Indenting

-   Indenting improves readability

-   Fixing line length (80 columns) prevents lots of nesting and very
    long functions

-   Suggested: Indents of 4 spaces at minimum; 8 spaces ideal
